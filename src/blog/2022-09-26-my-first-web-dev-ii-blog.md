If you can keep your head when all about you\
   Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;\
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\
   But make allowance for their doubting too;\
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\
   Or, being lied about, don’t deal in lies,\
Or, being hated, don’t give way to hating,\
   And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;\
   If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;\
If you can meet with triumph and disaster\
   And treat those two impostors just the same;\
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken\
   Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\
Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,\
   And stoop and build ’em up with wornout tools;
