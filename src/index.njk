      <h1 class="section-title">Starting my Web Dev Journey</h1>
      <p>I am currently a student learning about web development. Even though
      I am not perfect, I always try my best to keep learning, no matter
      how difficult some topics may be. I hope to inspire others to come
      along on this journey with me!</p>
      <p>Below are some of my favourite articles, which includes a poem by Rudyard Kipling and 
      a blog on how even professional web developers do not know everything.</p>
